I found this problem really tricky. It took me hundreds of kilometers on the highway to finally break it :-)
Also, a good dose of TDD helped a lot on this one as well. 

I think the code has turned out somewhat readable, and I have added a few comments to the top of most files. 

A few general notes: 
 - Any player's turn may have associated actions, not just Lil's
 - In fact, I don't distinguish between the players at all in the simulation

These choices make my code more generic, but they may also stand in
the way of some clever shortcuts. Because obviously I'm not using all
information given in the puzzle text.

Instead I'm simply running the simulation, recursively checking which
"turn resolutions" (turn + signal) prove valid all the way to the end
of the game.
