# Best Scrabble Opening

In this puzzle you will try to find the best first move in a Scrabble-like game. You will be given:

- A set of lettered tiles. Each tile have a letter and a value. If two tiles have the same letter, they will have the same value.
- A dictionary of the words you can use. Be careful, because not all the words in the dictionary will be compatible with your tiles.
- A board divided into squares. Each square will have an associated multiplication factor.

You can form words anywhere you want on the board, but they should read from left to right or from top to bottom. When forming a word, your points are calculated by multiplying the value of each letter by the value of the square in the board.

## Problem

Your task is to find the best opening word and its position on the board.
