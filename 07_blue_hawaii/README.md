I knew that this one would be relatively easy, so I created a very
simple high-level spec that simply checked the sample input/output.

Having a shortcut for running this single spec, I could sort of TDD my
way forward, with a bit of exploratory "pp"s here and there. Worked
really well, because the problem is so small and I had a pretty good idea about how I wanted to solve it even before I got started.
